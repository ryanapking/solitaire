# Freecell Solitaire Game

Made with React and MobX.

This whole game is needlessly complicated. I had an idea for a game involving freecell solitaire and a changing, partially-documented API. It was an ambitious idea that would have never caught on. This is what's left. The freecell part is playable, and certain commands can be run from the console on the right. The whole thing is like a rube goldberg machine that I was going to turn into a game. I learned a lot about MobX, at least.
